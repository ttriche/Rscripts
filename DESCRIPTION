Title: Accumulated code that Tim takes for granted and other people request
Version: 0.9.999
Authors: Tim Triche <tim.triche@gmail.com>, Asif Zubair, probably others
Description: Over the years I have, like most programmers, ended up with some convenience functions that I tend to rely upon and trainees/collaborators ask for. These include things like `phelp`, `dtach`, and other linguistic abominations, as well as a version of print.data.frame() that uses IRanges and doesn't suck. Note that in actual practice, I just source all the files in Rscripts/R/, because I am a caveman typing into a terminal with green letters. Also note that this is accomplished via .Rprofile, and my .Rprofile is linked into system.file("extdata", ".Rprofile", package="Rscripts") so that I don't forget where I put it. If this sounds a lot like the ravings of a crazy man, that's because it is.
